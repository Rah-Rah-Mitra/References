#  The code to predict a future value from a machine learning model depends
#  on the specific model and the programming language you are using. However,
#  here is an example of how to predict a future value using a scikit-learn library
#  in Python, which is a popular machine learning library:

# Import the necessary libraries
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X_train = []
y_train = []
input_value = []

# Create a Linear Regression object
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model using the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the output for a new input
future_value = model.predict([[input_value]])

# Print the predicted output
print(future_value)

# In this example, X_train is the training data for the input features,
#  y_train is the training data for the target variable, LinearRegression()
#  is the Linear Regression model, model.fit(X_train, y_train) is used to train the model,
#  model.predict([[input_value]]) is used to predict the output for a new input value,
#  and print(future_value) is used to print the predicted output.

# It's important to note that this is an example for Linear Regression and
#  you should use the appropriate model for your problem, and also this code
#  should be adjusted depending on the specific structure of your dataset and
#  the problem you are trying to solve.
